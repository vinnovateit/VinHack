Hacking is building things that you always wanted to have but no one has built it yet. It's to come up with an amazing idea and work tirelessly on it. It is to fail, fail again and fail better. Try out new things and learn while doing that. It's to work together, collaborate and build things that are innovative. It is to be a better programmer.

**With that spirit, [VinnovateIT](https://vinnovateit.com/) is conducting a hackathon, [VinHack](https://vinhack.hackerearth.com/) and invites all developers and hackathon enthusiasts to participate in an interesting and engaging hackathon.**

## Everyone is welcome!
Whether you’re writing your first lines of HTML, building a AR/VR app, VinHack is just the place for you. We will have mentors to help make your idea happen. You will be able to exhibit your skills without worrying about any mortal needs. We will take care of everything :)

## Why should you attend?
[![smile please](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/makes-people-smile.svg)](https://vinhack.hackerearth.com/)

#### To make new friends
> **VinHack** provides a brilliant opportunity for you and your team to forge professional contacts and make new friends. With over 300 developers and designers gathering from all the engineering branches in [VIT Vellore](http://www.vit.ac.in/), grab your chance of connecting with people to discuss ideas and opportunities.

#### To learn
> Hackathons are a great way to give back to the community. Mentoring beginners is always helpful for them and rewarding for us. We’re going to have mentors from a number of different organizations present at the venue. Whenever you’re stuck on a problem or need suggestions they'll always be within a hand’s reach.

#### To build
> We are inviting everyone to build on ideas of their choice. Watching software materialize from pure thought, part by part is the closest to experiencing magic we have ever got to. And we’re excited to see that magic happen all over again!

## Judging Criteria

Teams will be judged on these five criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.

- **Technology:** How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go “Wow”?

- **Design:** Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).

- **Completion:** Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?

- **Usefulness and Feasibility** - How useful and feasible your solution is? Does it  meet the purpose or goal of the given problem statement.

- **Future Plans** - How can you extend your idea in future?

> #### These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.

**It’s important to note that these judging criteria do not include:**

How good your code is. It doesn’t matter if your code is messy, or not well commented, or uses inefficient algorithms. Hacking is about playing around, making mistakes, and learning new things. If your code isn’t production ready, we’re not going to mark you down.
